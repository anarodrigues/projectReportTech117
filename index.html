create a simple html page for a technical report for a first year engineering student to provide a summary of their project. The page should include the following sections: title, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use basic HTML structure with appropriate headings and paragraphs. Include a simple CSS style to enhance readability. The project will be done using an Arduino kit.
